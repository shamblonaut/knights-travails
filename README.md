# knights-travails

Find the shortest path between two squares for a knight

## Try it yourself!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shamblonaut/knights-travails
cd knights-travails
node . "[0, 0]" "[7, 7]"
```

Feel free to replace the last two strings (the first one is the start point, and the second is the end point) with any squares. The limits are 0 through 7, vertically and horizontally.
